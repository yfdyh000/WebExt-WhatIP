# WhatIP - WebExtension

This add-on for Firefox 57(+) is designed to replace the old [ShowIP](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/showip/) add-on (and maybe [FlagFox](https://addons.mozilla.org/FR/firefox/addon/flagfox/) too).  

Done all by myself from scratch, still in alpha stage, feel free fork, report issues and suggest features. ;)  

## TODO

* Countryflag
* WhoIS shortcut
